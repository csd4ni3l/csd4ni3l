## Hi there 👋

I’m Daniel (csd4ni3l). I’m from Hungary, and I’ve grown up tinkering with computers/programming. Linux has been my workplace since I was little, i never really used Windows for long time. Right now I’m using Arch Linux on my laptop, and I mess around with Python, basic web stuff and system-level tools.
(Though i will probably switch to NixOS soon)

I spend a lot of time building. Sometimes I write small games or graphics experiments, sometimes tools for myself.

On top of that I like to self-host. I use Proxmox and Proxmox Backup Server on my mini PC. It’s nice to build a little sandbox where I can host my own password manager, game servers, todos and more.
