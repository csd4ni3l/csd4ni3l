## Hi there 👋

I’m Daniel (csd4ni3l). I’m from Hungary, and I’ve grown up tinkering with computers/programming. Linux has been my workplace since I was little, i never really used Windows for a long time. 
Right now I’m using Arch Linux on my laptop, and I mess around with Python and basic web stuff.
I am currently learning Rust to be more familiar with compiled languages and how executables are built up.

I spend a lot of time coding. Sometimes I write small games and sometimes just random tools and stuff.

On top of that I like to self-host my own stuff for privacy & security. 
I use Proxmox and Proxmox Backup Server on my mini PC. 
I've built myself a sandbox where I host my own password manager, game servers, todo app, etc
